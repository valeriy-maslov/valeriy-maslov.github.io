# Comment Policy of vmaslov.dev

**Please read this before posting any comment**

Hi, Valeriy is here!

Welcome to my personal website and blog. Thank you for paying attention to it.

I try my best to make sure that the discussions on my articles are the troll, spam and abuse free but I'm not omnipresent.  
To ensure that you have a good time here, please make sure to stick to the following guidelines:

- **Be polite** – don’t be rude to anyone and respect others. 
If something you said would get you bottled on the head offline, please don’t say it here. 
Remember there is a person behind the screen and that your words affect people.
- **Don’t troll.** I appreciate and welcome criticism here, 
but comments that add no value to the discussion 
or that are merely insulting would be deleted without exception and authors of such comments will be banned forever.
- **Spam? Goodbye.** I understand that you may make thousands of dollars working from home, 
however, no one is interested. 
Please refrain from posting, or I’ll give you a hand and show both you and your post the door.

**To make things simple, these guidelines boil down to “Don’t be a dick”.** 

If you don’t follow any of these guidelines, 
not only I will remove the comment, but I may also ban you from participating in the discussions.
I don't do any warnings, if you're violated this - you're banned forever, that's it.
Please note that this is my personal blog and website.
So I am not obliged to answer about the reasons of the ban.

If you find any comments which violate our guidelines, 
please make sure to ‘flag’ or ‘mark as spam’ – I highly appreciate your support!

Thank you for your understanding, I really appreciate that. Happy commenting!
